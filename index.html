                    <p>The ING Bank released a mobile banking app in october 2011. Over a period of over two years I was involved with the development of various features on the ING Mobile Banking iOS App. The iOS app was developed by a team of 5 developers of which I was part. The team operated in a larger context with a number of other teams providing the server side code and implementations for other mobile platforms.</p>
                <p>The app has a consistent 4.5 star rating.</p>

<p>The MITS Company requested my help for the implementation of a billing system to help further automate their financial processing of customers. The system looked simple enough to implement on first thought, but because of specific business needs a lot of flexibility needed to be added. The goal of this project was to implement a system enabling the business to generate invoices to customers based on the services and data transfer volumes. The customers themselves mostly operate by buying the services from MITS wholesale and then reselling these to their respective clientele. Due to this structure invoices are created for each customer based on the clientele services by the customer of the MITS company.</p>
<p>With the MITS Billing project I took part in the implementation of the system. Besides my technical expertise as a software developer I was tasked with providing guidance to several junior employees. The architect of the system is based on the current architectural recommendation written by my employer InfoSupport.</p>

<p>For the vtsPN (a company responsible for the implementation and exploitation of IT solutions for the Dutch police services) I have been involved with the maintenance of one of their broker applications. The application deals with investigative data from various national and international sources. The application implements an XML SOAP based interface to front-end applications. Through this SOAP interface front-end applications are able to request data from the various non-unified back-end systems in a unified data format. To maintain this application a workbench application was built and maintained. By importing the back-end service definitions the workbench application was able to allow the generation of the broker configurations after receiving user input on how to map the back-end services.</p>
<p>On this project I was responsible for the maintenance of the workbench product. The workbench product was an Eclipse RCP based application. I also was the technical reference concerning all matters related to XML Schema and XSLT. I was also responsible for the upgrading of the application from WebSphere 5.1 to WebSphere 6.0.</p>

<p>For the Dutch police services an application had to be developed called PSO2. PSO stands for &#8220;Politie Suite Opsporing&#8221; which basically means &#8220;Police Investigation Suite&#8221;. The goal of the project was to build a supporting application for police related investigation of the Dutch Police and the Criminal Investigations Department. In this process a number of information sources were available within the Dutch police network that had to be disclosed and be made accessible via a web based front-end. One of the systems PSO2 would connect to was Everest (see my previous project experiences).</p>
<p>In this project I fulfilled the role of developer. My tasks included developing and maintaining a JSP tag library. There were also a number of maintenance related activities on a number of framework components which was based on the OMG Model Drive Architecture principles. Areas of work included expanding the event handling mechanism and building audit logging facilities into the event mechanism.</p>

<p>For the rebuild of an existing application there were no functional specifications available. To make sure that a realistic offer could be developed by a number of contractors, the system owner tasked me and a colleague to make a rough analysis of the majority of the functionality of the system. This basically involved analysing the existing implementation. The application involved serves about 200.000 users. The users are Dutch companies. Every company in the Netherlands has to deduct certain taxes of of the wages of their employees. The system provides this information to a majority of all Dutch companies. All tax rates are based on a number of variables which depend on the work performed by the companies. The companies can access their &#8220;personal&#8221; tax rates through this system. The current implementation was based on Oracle 9i Portal Server.</p>

<p>In this project I was a Java developer in the web client team of the Everest Application. Activities involved implementing gui functionality in the the Struts based web interface. The web application uses Struts Tiles. These Tiles contain the presentation as JSP snippets.</p>
<p>The Everest program contained a number of projects to improve the Dutch Police information infrastructure. The goal of the program was to develop a central nation wide information system containing Dutch, European and worldwide warrant information. The system should be available to all authorised Dutch parties involved in criminal investigation.</p>
